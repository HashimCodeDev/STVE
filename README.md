# Probos
Probos acts as a trust firewall between raw field sensors and billion-rupee agricultural decisions. In large-scale precision agriculture, automated irrigation and nutrient systems rely on thousands of distributed sensors whose failures are often silent yet highly impactful. STVE continuously audits incoming sensor data in real time, validating it against behavioral patterns, neighboring sensors, and independent environmental signals before it is allowed to influence operational logic. By dynamically assigning trust scores, suppressing unreliable inputs, and triggering maintenance actions, the engine prevents faulty or drifting sensors from propagating errors into high-stakes agronomic decisions. This trust layer transforms sensor networks from passive data collectors into a self-verifying infrastructure, ensuring that critical resource allocations are driven only by credible, physically consistent data.
