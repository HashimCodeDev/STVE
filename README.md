# Probos
Probos is a physics-based verification engine for wind curtailment claims. It compares operator-reported wind speeds with independent weather data and applies aerodynamic power equations to detect overestimation. Each claim receives a Trust Score, and suspicious deviations trigger alerts and audit logs.
